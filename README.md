# The Lotto

## The Lotto raises money for good causes.
People use funding to do extraordinary things, taking the lead to improve their lives and communities. Every time you buy/spend/transfer **$LOTTO** tokens you help make this happen. Communities come in all shapes and sizes, and The Lotto funding is there for everyone. Our community fund will help fund projects and activities that transform communities, protect our heritage, and enrich lives through arts, sports and culture.

All community funds will be voted for monthly by the community. 

# Tokenomics
We have a standard 11% tax which is split into:
* 7% To the community fund,
* 2% Reflection to holders,
* 1% Goes into a weekly holders lotto
* 1% Gets discarded,

# Our funding principles:
* **We will do more than support organisations to survive and continue; we want to support communities to thrive and grow.**
This means pro-actively seeking to support activity which enables organisations to work in new ways including becoming more digitally capable, enabling even more mutual help, and building and strengthening the social and civic infrastructure that can nurture and support community actions. It also means working hard to ensure that we engage with everyone who can help make that happen. 

* **We will use our funding to continue to support people and communities most affected by COVID-19 building on and strengthening the connections, organisation and resilience which enables communities to thrive.**
This includes ensuring that we continue to fund flexibly, engaging and supporting new and established organisations to enhance and build on vital community support and action which has been highlighted by COVID-19.

* **We will convene, listen and learn the lessons of the pandemic.**
We will make sure we engage with all the communities we serve across the world and work hard to ensure that our funding is shaped by, and responsive to, their experience. We will share what we learn and help to broker ways in which those we fund and those we work with can learn from each other and help to ensure more joined up understanding and responses to issues as they emerge.

* **We want to ensure that our approach as a funder is straightforward and supportive.**
This means we recognise that some organisations will need more support from us to access our funding and that we will manage our funding relationships so that organisations are able to respond to the changing needs of the communities they serve now and in the future.
